# Preliminary results of Switchboard relativizer study

Plotted are the distributions of relativizers (in proportions) across different variables. Numbers above the bars indicate the number of contributing cases. This is to facilitate making sense of what look like differences from looking at the height of the bars: the greater the number of contributing cases, the more likely the difference is real.
